# The Sixth Blood: build notes

Source of truth for story and design is the "Daywalker Series Design Notes" doc (https://claude.ai/artifact/2Gd9QjYxgpiwK2pXKjWids). This file tracks the build only. It is spoiler free by design: no chapter plans, choices or twists belong here.

## How it is built

- One PWA on GitHub Pages, all seven books in one app so saves carry over. Plain JavaScript modules, no build step, no dependencies. Open `index.html` through any static server.
- The engine is separate from the story. Each chapter is one `.tsb` file loaded only when played (docs/SCRIPT_FORMAT.md).
- Chapters compile to flat operation lists, so the story position is just (scene, position) and saving mid chapter is simple and exact.
- Engine code never touches the DOM or storage directly (`engine/game.js` takes a loader and a storage), so the whole game plays from a Node test.
- Run `npm test` and `npm run check` before every commit.

## File map

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `engine/expr.js` | Safe expression language (no eval). |
| `engine/script.js` | `.tsb` parser and compiler, with line numbered errors. |
| `engine/runner.js` | Executes a chapter to the next wait point. Also `relocate()` for edited chapters. |
| `engine/validate.js` | Cross chapter checks (missing scenes, unreachable scenes, fall off the end). |
| `engine/state.js` | State shape, stat clamping, `SCHEMA` and schema migrations. |
| `engine/versioning.js` | Upgrades old saves (schema and content migrations). |
| `engine/saves.js` | Slots, autosave support, backups, export and import, profile. |
| `engine/game.js` | Controller: loading chapters, chapter flow, autosave, load with repair. |
| `engine/fetch-loader.js`, `node-loader.js` | Content loaders for browser and Node. |
| `app/` | Minimal reader UI (start screen, story view, saves dialog). |
| `content/` | `manifest.json`, `stats.json`, `migrations.js`, chapters. |
| `tests/` | `node --test` suites. |
| `tools/check.js` | Content checker (`npm run check`). |

## Build plan progress

Engine, 4 sessions, then books. The full 85 session checklist with commands is in the "The Sixth Blood Build Sessions" doc.

- [x] Session 1: engine core, script format, saves, save versioning
- [ ] Session 2: flags, story voice stats, pronouns and names, origin variants, library screen
- [ ] Session 3: game systems
- [ ] Session 4: player features, developer tools, look and feel, sample chapter

### Session 1 notes (for the next session)

- The library screen, settings, fonts, book accents and the real app icon are not built. `app/` is a plain working shell for testing the engine on a phone.
- `content/stats.json` lists the stats from the design doc with placeholder ranges and starting values. Tune them in session 2 or 3 when the systems exist.
- Per person stats use wildcard names (`loyalty.*`, `bond.*`).
- The `engine-test` book in the manifest is flagged `"dev": true`. Session 2's library screen should hide dev books outside developer mode.
- Systems from session 3 plug in through `fns` and `commands` on the `Game` constructor, so they need no parser changes.
- Rewind last choice (a player feature) is not built. The state is one plain object, so keeping the previous state before each choice is straightforward.
- Hosting: turn on GitHub Pages for the repo (Settings, Pages, deploy from the `main` branch root). All paths are relative, so the project page URL works.
